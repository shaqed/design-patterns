	- Complexity

	Development Methodologies
		- Waterfall
		- Evolutionary Methods
			- Incremental Method
			- Iterative Method
				- Spiral
				- Agile
					- Extreme Programming [XP] - Rules
						- Simplicity
							- Metaphor
							- Simple Design
							- Refactoring
						- Communication
							- On-site Customer
							- Pair programming
							- Coding standards
						- Feedback
							- Testing
							- Keep Integrating
							- Small releases
						- Courage
							- Planning game
								- Driven
									- Story Driven
									- Date Driven
								- Plan		
									- IPT - 				Ideal Programming Time
									- Load Factor - 		How much to multiply the IPT to get a real estimate
									- Velocity - 			How much IPT you have per iteration, the more people - the less Velocity. 
								- Control Variables 		(pick 3, the last one is derived by the 3)
									- Cost
									- Time
									- Quality
									- Scope 
							- Collective code ownership
							- Sustainable pace 
							- Open workspace
							- Daily standup meeting
					- Test Driven Development [TDD]
						- Cycle of development
							- Red
							- Green
							- Refactor
Testing
	- V&V
		- Verification
			- Static
				- Software Inspection
				- Static analysis
				- Formal Verification
			- Dynamic
				- Running the code (Unit testing)
		- Validation
			- Static [NO STATIC]
			- Dynamic
				- Component Testing
				- Integration Testing
