	Development Methodologies
		- Waterfall
		- Evolutionary Methods
			- Incremental Method
			- Iterative Method
				- Spiral
				- Agile
					- Extreme Programming [XP] - Rules
						- Simplicity
							- Metaphor
							- Simple Design
							- Refactoring
						- Communication
							- On-site Customer
							- Pair programming
							- Coding standards
						- Feedback
							- Testing
							- Keep Integrating
							- Small releases
						- Courage
							- Planning game
							    - Moves
							        - Write a story
							        - Estimate a cost of that story
							            - IPT (Ideal programming time)
							            - Load Factor (How much to multiply that IPT to get a real estimate)
							            - Velocity (Number of ideal weeks per iteration)
							        - Make Commitment
							            - Story driven
							            - Date driven
							    - Value and Risk
							        - Business Value first
							        - Worst Thing First
								- Control Variables 		(pick 3, the last one is derived by the 3)
									- Cost
									- Time
									- Quality
									- Scope 
							- Collective code ownership
							- Sustainable pace 
							- Open workspace
							- Daily standup meeting
					- Test Driven Development [TDD]
						- Cycle of development
							- Red
							- Green
							- Refactor
						- Techniques
						    - Fake it til you make it
						    - Triangulate
						    - Obvious Implementation
Testing
	- V&V
		- Verification
			- Static
				- Software Inspection
